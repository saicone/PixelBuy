Welcome to PixelBuy wiki, here you find information about PixelBuy setup and usage with single and multiple servers, including any store type hook.

## Introduction

There are multiple plugins to setup a donation system for your Minecraft server, mainly managed by other companies with regulations, subscriptions and handled in a single-command delivery.

Some people who want an independent donation handling made plugins to provide a self-hosted solution like WooMinecraft (By JayWood), a plugin that has been abandoned for a while.

PixelBuy aims to be a solution for server owners who want a customizable donation system independently of hosting services, with a centralized database.

## Features

* Handle multiple stores at the same time.
* Customizable delivery executions.
* Wide support with custom items plugins.
* Multi-host compatibility with donation executions.
* Offline player support.
